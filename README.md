# Hi there, I'm Mauri! 👋

I am a **Full-Stack Developer** in training based in Granada, Spain. My professional journey is built on a foundation of **Tourism and Innovation**, having lived and worked in the UK, Slovakia, and various cities in Spain. 🌍

### 🚀 My Path into Tech
Currently, I am pivoting my career toward the technology sector while working at **Muziker** in International Customer Service. Managing multiple global markets simultaneously has sharpened my ability to solve complex problems under pressure and communicate across cultures—skills I now apply to writing clean, efficient code.

- 🛠️ **The Bootcamp:** I'm currently immersed in a Full-Stack program at **[4Geeks Academy](https://github.com/4geeksacademy)**, mastering **HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and React**.
- 🎯 **The Mission:** My goal is to transition into a Software Support or Junior Developer role where I can combine my background in international service with my passion for technology.
- 🏗️ **Current Projects:** Building interactive web applications (like my current Kanto Pokedex project!) to solidify my understanding of modern frameworks.

### 🌟 Beyond the Code
I’ve always been driven by a deep curiosity about how the world works and where we are headed as a species. My interests are a reflection of that:

- 🏠 **Tech & Innovation:** I'm fascinated by home automation (**Smart Home**), technological evolution, and the latest hardware.
- 🎮 **Entertainment:** A lifelong fan of video games, cinema, and Science Fiction.
- 🌌 **The Big Picture:** I enjoy exploring topics like space exploration and the mysteries of human consciousness.
- ⚽ **Balance:** To keep my mind sharp, I follow football and stay active through sports.
